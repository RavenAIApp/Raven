				<h3>Weaviate <i class="el-icon-s-data"></i></h3>
				<p> <a href="https://https://weaviate.io/">Weaviate</a> is a knowledge graph engine that helps developers understand and interpret user input, extract information from input data, and execute queries against a knowledge graph. It is built on the graph theory, and uses an object-oriented programming model to store, query, and explore data.</p>
				<p> With Weaviate, developers can develop applications that use natural language processing (NLP) to understand user intent, retrieve and store data, and query the knowledge graph.</p>
				<h3>Group Manager <i class="el-icon-service"></i></h3>
				<p>A group manager, responsible for organizing and consolidating user-generated posts, can provide valuable question-and-answer services to the community. By actively monitoring and categorizing the content shared within the group, they enable members to quickly find relevant information and solutions to their queries. This streamlined access to knowledge fosters an efficient learning environment and helps to build a strong network of support and collaboration among the community members.</p>

				<p>Furthermore, the group manager can use AI-powered tools to enhance their ability to manage the group effectively. These tools can automatically identify frequently asked questions, detect emerging trends, and even offer personalized recommendations based on individual preferences and interests. By leveraging the power of AI, the group manager can ensure that the community stays well-informed, engaged, and continues to thrive in an ever-evolving digital landscape.</p>
