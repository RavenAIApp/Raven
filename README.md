# Raven AI

Raven AI is an intelligent group assistant for Facebook Groups, powered by AI and machine learning. Our tool helps group moderators manage and moderate their communities more efficiently, by analyzing group posts and comments and suggesting the best course of action.

## What we're doing

We're passionate about creating the best user experience possible for our users and helping them to maximize their social media presence. With Raven AI, you can be sure that your Facebook Groups will be managed in the most efficient and effective way.

## How it works

Our tool uses three main technologies to function:

- **ChatGPT:** an open-source natural language processing (NLP) library that enables developers to easily create conversational interfaces.
- **Weaviate:** a knowledge graph engine that helps developers understand and interpret user input, extract information from input data, and execute queries against a knowledge graph.
- **Messenger bot:** a chatbot that allows users to interact with a business or service via a messaging app like Facebook Messenger, Slack, or Telegram.

Our chatbot interacts with group members and collects feedback, questions, and complaints. The collected data is then processed by Weaviate, which extracts relevant information and creates a knowledge graph. Our machine learning algorithms analyze the knowledge graph and detect patterns and anomalies that require moderator attention. The moderator receives real-time notifications and suggestions on how to handle the situation, based on our AI's analysis. The moderator can approve or reject the suggestions and take manual action if needed.

## Who can benefit from Raven AI

Our tool is ideal for anyone who manages a Facebook group, whether it's a small community or a large organization. Raven AI can help you save time, reduce stress, and increase the quality of your group's content. Some examples of groups that can benefit from our technology are:

- Non-profit organizations that rely on Facebook groups to connect with their supporters and donors.
- Businesses that use Facebook groups for customer service, marketing, or employee collaboration.
- Social media managers who handle multiple groups and need to streamline their workflow.
- Individuals who run hobby or interest groups and want to create a positive and engaging community.
